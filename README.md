On the project we have 3 AQA, 6 MQA and 1 Perf QA. In the most beginning of the project customer assigned all AQAs without MQAs, but the team couldn't provide in-sprint testing of new feature, and it was desided to assign several MQAs.
Now our AQAs have a huge debt and their own backlog of tasks, created per each user story. They're focusing now on API tests. UI tests are skipped. The situation is not so good, because we have a lot of issues with pipelines, forming reports by Jenkins,  frequently changing passwords for test accounts, etc. We have nightly runs for regression scope: API tests and a little part of UI tests, which were written long time ago.
